# Pseudocode for Password Managers Project

Class PasswordManagers:
    # Initialize the class
    Function __init__:
        - Initialize password_managers as a list of popular password managers to be tested
        - Initialize ct_log_analysis as an instance of the CTLogs class
        - Initialize phishing_domains as an empty list to store domains with suspicious patterns from CT logs
        - Initialize results to store test outcomes for each password manager

    # Identify phishing-prone domains from CT logs
    Function identify_phishing_prone_domains:
        - Fetch and parse CT log data using ct_log_analysis.fetch_log_list and ct_log_analysis.fetch_ct_log_entries
        - Use ct_log_analysis.parse_certificates to structure data
        - Call ct_log_analysis.analyze_patterns to identify suspicious patterns
        - For each domain in the analyzed patterns:
            - If patterns indicate phishing risk (e.g., frequent CA changes, rapid re-issuance), add domain to phishing_domains

    # Define phishing test cases based on CT log insights
    Function define_phishing_test_cases:
        - Initialize test_cases as an empty list
        - For each domain in phishing_domains:
            - Create test cases with variations in certificate configurations such as:
                - Valid lookalike domains with legitimate certificates
                - Domains with recent re-issued certificates
                - Domains with expired certificates
                - Domains with certificates from untrusted or unknown CAs
            - Append each case to test_cases
        - Return test_cases

    # Test password managersâ€™ response to phishing scenarios
    Function test_password_managers(test_cases):
        - For each password_manager in password_managers:
            - For each case in test_cases:
                - Simulate visiting the phishing site (use a controlled environment)
                - Observe password_manager's response:
                    - Check if autofill is triggered, blocked, or if any warnings are displayed
                - Record response in results under the password_manager and case details
        - Return results

    # Analyze results to identify vulnerabilities
    Function analyze_vulnerabilities(results):
        - Initialize vulnerability_analysis as an empty dictionary
        - For each password_manager in results:
            - Initialize counters for failures to detect phishing and adequate responses
            - For each test case result:
                - If autofill was incorrectly triggered, increment failure counter
                - If phishing warning or block was triggered, increment adequate response counter
            - Add vulnerability report to vulnerability_analysis for each password_manager with failure rates and patterns of detection weaknesses
        - Return vulnerability_analysis

    # Correlate password manager weaknesses with CT log patterns
    Function correlate_weaknesses_with_patterns(vulnerability_analysis, phishing_domains):
        - Initialize correlation_results as an empty dictionary
        - For each pattern in phishing_domains' patterns:
            - Check if similar patterns are linked to high failure rates in vulnerability_analysis
            - If a strong correlation is identified, add to correlation_results
        - Return correlation_results

    # Generate report with recommendations
    Function generate_report(vulnerability_analysis, correlation_results):
        - Print a summary of findings, including:
            - Password managers with highest vulnerability rates and common failure scenarios
            - CT log patterns that show high correlation with vulnerabilities in password managers
            - Specific recommendations for password manager improvements (e.g., handling frequent CA changes, strengthening EV/DV differentiation)
        - Save the report as a document for future analysis and recommendations

# Main program flow
Function main:
    - Initialize analysis as an instance of PasswordManagers
    - Call analysis.identify_phishing_prone_domains to gather phishing-prone domains
    - Call analysis.define_phishing_test_cases to create test cases based on CT log patterns
    - Perform tests using analysis.test_password_managers
    - Analyze vulnerabilities using analysis.analyze_vulnerabilities
    - Correlate findings with CT log patterns using analysis.correlate_weaknesses_with_patterns
    - Generate and output final report with analysis.generate_report
